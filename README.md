https://rishika-afk.github.io/Easyy-Couriers/

The "Easyy Couriers" project is a database management system (DBMS) application that facilitates courier management operations. It allows users to book parcels for delivery, update delivery statuses, and provide feedback. The system is designed to handle multiple branches, staff members, and parcels. The database schema includes tables for branches, staffs, parcels, and pricing. Users can log in using their credentials, and upon successful login, they are redirected to the dashboard where they can access various functionalities. The project employs Flask, a Python web framework, for server-side processing and uses MySQL as the database management system. It provides a user-friendly interface for efficient courier management and tracking.
